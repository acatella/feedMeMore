          <span class="wave-icon"></span>
          <p class="hero-text">
            The View Ridge Swim Team is a summer league swim team and is open to all member children beginning at age five through their senior year graduating from high school. At View Ridge, we value inclusion, teamwork, good sportsmanship, and fun. We hope to see all swimmers develop life skills through their involvement in summer league swimming and encourage everyone to be lifelong swimmers. The coaches strive to create strong relationships with all swimmers and encourage them to do the same with their teammates.
            <br><br>
            View Ridge is a member of the Greater Seattle Summer Swim League (GSSSL), which is comprised of 16 teams divided evenly into Northern and Southern Divisions. The GSSSL has been in existence since 1960 to promote recreational and competitive swimming.  The swim team season starts in mid-May with evening practices, preparing for the summer.  Once Seattle Public Schools begin summer break, practices switch to the mornings. The competitive season is made up of seven dual meets against Northern GSSSL clubs (Aqua Club, Blue Ridge, Innis Arden, Klahaya, Sand Point Country Club, Sheridan Beach, Wedgwood), followed by post regular season qualifying championship meets. The season culminates with the All City Championship Finals meet on the first Tuesday in August, which is when the entire league (Northern and Southern teams) comes together to complete the season.
