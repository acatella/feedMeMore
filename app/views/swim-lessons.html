            <h3>Minnow I and II (for ages 4 - 5)</h3>
            <p class="hero-text">
              These classes recognize the developmental stage of children this age. They are designed to move the young swimmer from comfort and enjoyment of the water to basic strokes. Patience and fun are emphasized.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="class-container">
            <h3>Minnow III (for ages 4 - 5)</h3>
            <p class="hero-text">
              This class is for little ones who are very comfortable in the water and can easily float anywhere in the pool. While they may be comfortable playing in the water, they are ready to learn the basic coordination required for traditional strokes.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="class-container">
            <h3>Non-Floater (for ages 5 &amp; up)</h3>
            <p class="hero-text">
              This class is for older children who need to become comfortable in the water. They will work toward putting their face in the water and ultimately floating. These children usually have some real fear of the water, so patience will be emphasized.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="class-container">
            <h3>Floater (for ages 5 &amp; up)</h3>
            <p class="hero-text">
              This class is for older children who are somewhat comfortable in the water, can put their face in the water for a period of time, and are floating well. We will work on many prerequisites to swimming, like kicking and using their arms.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="class-container">
            <h3>Beginner I</h3>
            <p class="hero-text">
              These swimmers are ready for the complicated coordination required of the crawl stroke. Students will also spend a great deal of time on their back and doing other activities to increase their confidence in deeper water. Correct technique will come before distance, and safety will be stressed.

            <h3>Beginner II</h3>
            <p class="hero-text">
              The crawl stroke will be improved (an emphasis placed on side breathing), more time spent on their back. Other skills are introduced such as treading water, underwater swimming, and diving from the side of the pool.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="class-container">
            <h3>Advanced Beginner</h3>
            <p class="hero-text">
              This class will continue the progression towards a relaxed and efficient crawl stroke and backstroke. The breaststroke kick will be introduced. There will also be an increase in drills to help with continued skill development.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="class-container">
            <h3>Beginner Intermediate</h3>
            <p class="hero-text">
              This class offers continued stroke development through increased distances. Breaststroke will be introduced.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="class-container">
            <h3>Intermediate</h3>
            <p class="hero-text">
              Strokes will continue to be improved with a great deal of emphasis on the breaststroke, a difficult yet valuable stroke. This class is often repeated by a swimmer because the skills take time to perfect.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="class-container">
            <h3>Racing</h3>
            <p class="hero-text">
              This class offers an emphasis on competitive strokes and turns, and designed to help a swim team member. Swim team workouts are not always the best place to makes sure strokes are efficient and correct, Racing is an opportunity for focused time on getting the right technique.

          View Ridge Swim &amp; Tennis Club allows its staff to teach privates lessons. We feel that they are valuable in several situations such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li class="bl-item"><span class="hero-text">A child who needs one-on-one contact with an instructor to become comfortable enough for regular lessons.</span></li>

          <li class="bl-item"><span class="hero-text">Special needs children can learn with close contact with an instructor.</span></li>
          <li class="bl-item"><span class="hero-text">Older children and adults who do not fit in with younger children in class.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="hero-text">
          We feel that privates are never a substitute for regular lessons. Children learn best over time with other children.
