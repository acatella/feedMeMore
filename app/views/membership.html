            <li class="bl-item"><span class="hero-text">View Ridge Swim &amp; Tennis Club is a member-owned club, limited by our by-laws to 480 family memberships. There are currently 480 active members.</span></li>
            <li class="bl-item"><span class="hero-text">To join the club, a member must live within the boundaries: North: N. 110th Street, South: Ship Canal, East: Lake Washington, West: 25th N.E.</span></li>
            <li class="bl-item"><span class="hero-text">The main operating hours of the club (the pool, clubhouse and grounds) begin in mid-May through early September. The tennis courts are accessible year-round but the courts are not regularly maintained after the main operating months.</span></li>
            <li class="bl-item"><span class="hero-text">To join, the initial membership joining fee is $5,000. All but $1,700 of this will be refunded with the sale of the membership.</span></li>
            <li class="bl-item"><span class="hero-text">Yearly membership fees are summarized as follows:</span></li>
            <li class="bl-item sub-item"><span class="hero-text">Annual dues are $800.</span></li>
            <li class="bl-item sub-item"><span class="hero-text">Annual capital improvement fee of $500. 50% of your capital improvement fee is refunded with the sale of your membership.</span></li>
            <li class="bl-item sub-item"><span class="hero-text">Additional fees are assessed based on each family’s usage of the club’s benefits (i.e. swim team, tennis team, lessons and clinics, events, etc.).</span></li>
            <li class="bl-item"><span class="hero-text">At the present time, there is a waiting list of around 1,000 families. The number of new members varies from year to year, so it is impossible to predict how long it might take to become a member. The club is always interested in bringing in new members - new members add to the vitality of the club. However, we are restricted by capacity, the club’s Bylaws, and Articles of Incorporation.</span></li>
            <li class="bl-item"><span class="hero-text">If you are interested in being placed on the waiting list, there is a one-time fee of $100.  Please complete the Membership <a href="{{siteDocuments.waitlistApplication}}" target="_blank">Waiting List Form</a> and mail your payment to the stated address. </span></li>
